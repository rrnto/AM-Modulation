# AM-Modulation
Here, I demonstrate how to demodulate a signal. To do this, I first created a modulated signal by multiplying a message signal  𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) m(t) by a carrier signal  𝑐 ( 𝑡 ) c(t). Then, I attempt to recover the original message using two methods: Envelope Detection and Synchronous Demodulation
